Hi!

My name is Daniel and I am a Engineer from Munich, Germany.
In my job as a development engineer I am currently working on self driving cars.

Before working in the automotive industry I studied Mechatronics at the Munich University of Applied Sciences.

In my freetime I like to build cool stuff and travel the world.

In this Blog I want to share my experiences with you.
